Nessus:
works by testing each port on a computer, determining what service it is running, and then testing this 
service to make sure there are no vulnerabilities in it that could be used by a hacker to carry out a 
malicious attack.

There are several Nessus scan types available for different methods of scanning like:
Host Discovery, network scan, 
advance scan, malware scan, Credential and Audit patch and many more. Host Discovery is the most 
common one and the one which is used most of the time at the beginning of the scan
